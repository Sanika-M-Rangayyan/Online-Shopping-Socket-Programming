# Online-Shopping-Socket-Programming
The objective of the project was to replicate a simplified version of an Online Shopping Marketplace using Socket Programming.
To do so,I used Python to create the appropriate client and server files, with server being used for Inventory-Databasing and client replicating customers
It works on TCP to ensure reliability and practicality offered by the protocol.

Some of the functionalities in the project have been listed below
-> Shopping and Return : This enables user to select products in the inventory and the exchange part. The code handles all the conditions such as when the product
is out of stock and so on.

->Threading :  This allows multiple clients to access the server at the same time,increasing scalability of our project.

->CSV Database : Storing the user information in a CSV database.

Scope:
-Graphical user interface.
-Prevent database redundancy.
